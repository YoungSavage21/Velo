# Velo: A Web-Based Task Management System

Velo is a web application designed for efficient task management, offering features similar to popular platforms like Trello, including real-time collaboration features. Built using CodeIgniter 3, MySQL, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP, Velo provides a user-friendly interface for collaborative task tracking.

## What I Learned

During the development of Velo, I gained valuable skills and knowledge in the following areas:

- **CodeIgniter 3 and MVC:** I achieved proficiency in using the CodeIgniter 3 framework, embracing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to create a modular and organized codebase.

- **MySQL:** I developed a strong understanding of MySQL for efficient data management, including database design, querying, and optimization.

- **JavaScript and JQuery:** I acquired skills in client-side scripting with JavaScript and utilized the jQuery library to enhance the website's interactivity, resulting in a more dynamic user experience.

## Installation

To run Velo on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Set up a MySQL database and configure the database connection in the configuration files.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the application using a local server.
